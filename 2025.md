# 2025

## Explanation

I have less than 3 years in Cybersecurity. After done different research, I concluded that each domain of Cybersecurity are linked together. You shouldn't study the offensive, without studying the defensive to know how to get through it. This works for all areas : forensic, governance, ... knowledge in one area will have an impact on another area. This is why this year after obtaining the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) in 2024, I focused on Osint and base of Blue.

## FeedBack
[18/03/2025] Bugcrowd's profile system is not well designed. Reports made in collaboration are only displayed on one profile and only count as one profile even if the two profiles are set to 50% on the collaboration. Instead of putting my link profile with stats, I prefer to write a write-up.
