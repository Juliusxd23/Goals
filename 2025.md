# 2025

## Explanation

After done different research, I concluded that each domain of Cybersecurity are linked together. You shouldn't study the offensive, without studying the defensive to know how to get through it. This works for all areas : forensic, governance, ... knowledge in one area will have an impact on another area. This is why this year after obtaining the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) in 2024, I focused on Osint and base of Blue.

## Key Dates of the year
- [11/03/2025] First fork and pull request of my project "News_Cybersecurity" by [Hudsonrock-Partnerships](https://github.com/hudsonrock-partnerships)

## Event not initially planned
- [21/03/2025 - 26/06/2025] CTF Cyber Apocalypse 2025 by HackTheBox : 619/8130 Teams with friends from BrHackeuses community.
- [27/04/2025] Discovery of a challenge site to compete in subdomain research. 1 new target every day to know if our methodology is sufficient to find all the subdomains or if other people find more than us. This is extremely interesting to broaden the target's attack surface in real conditions (pentest, bug bounty, red team). The Website is [Recon-Royale](https://recon-royale.com/).
- [28/06/2025 - 29/06/2025] CTF by LeHack 2025 : 2/200+ Teams with EternalBlue
- [20/07/2025] Found a Medium Broken Access Control GraphQL Bug on Epower Program in collaboration with TheXssRat during an Live Bug Bounty session. Not count it on my goal, it was on a invite program and I don't got the invitation to that.

## FeedBack
- [18/03/2025] Bugcrowd's profile system is not well designed. Reports made in collaboration are only displayed on one profile and only count as one profile even if the two profiles are set to 50% on the collaboration. Instead of putting my link profile with stats, I prefer to write a write-up.
- [12/05/2025] AFP courses are very good to get an another point of view of Osint + really great extension made by AFP.
- [18/05/2025] Big crush on this course, the information, the methodology and above all learning through an, fictive, investigation.
- [19/05/2025] Security Blue is good to discover news links/resources, to go further on topics see during AFP and Basel courses + end by a practical investigation to earn the certificate.
- [20/05/2025] Replace Osint Fundamentals by Cybrary.it, don't exist anymore, by Osint Basic by Cybrary.it.
- [21/05/2025] Good resources to get a better view of te methodology but the pratical part doesn't work well.
- [26/05/2025] Bendobrown youtube playlist is a good playlist, to watch once and keep a note somewhere, so you can come back to see the examples if you get lost during an investigation.
- [03/06/2025] Replace Osint Workshop by [CyberInstitute](https://courses.thecyberinst.org/courses/osintworkshop) which isn't very pratical by some [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) rooms.
- [08/06/2025] Discover Hacktoria challenges from the medium link in "Tips" to prepare with some more pratical challenges.
- [18/06/2025] The exam is possible within 72 hours, my only remarks are that some questions lack clarity and were not seen during the course. I recommend watching all the courses like what I did to gain more knowledge.
- [19/07/2025] Introduction to Bug Bounty by [RedTeamLeaders](https://redteamleaders.coursestack.com/courses/9372210c-d41a-4893-b87c-ddf7076750e1) is a good first step in Bug Bounty. It gives a lot of information, on the steps to follow, the laws, the bug bounty cycle and also gives a description of some web vulnerabilities.
- [11/09/2025] The limitation of the bug bounty is really disabling. Reporting a real possible attack with the combination of several vulnerabilities, as this involves an employee, is outside the scope of the bug bounty and the report cannot be successful. It's a real shame to leave a company that is a client of the platform vulnerable simply because it falls outside the scope of the bug bounty.
- [15/10/2025] First bounty from OpenAI's program
- [19/10/2025] Report 4 new bugs in OpenAI's program
- [23/10/2025] New bounties from OpenAI's program
