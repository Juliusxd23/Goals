# 2025

## Explanation

I have less than 3 years in Cybersecurity. After done different research, I concluded that each domain of Cybersecurity are linked together. You shouldn't study the offensive, without studying the defensive to know how to get through it. This works for all areas : forensic, governance, ... knowledge in one area will have an impact on another area. This is why this year after obtaining the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) in 2024, I focused on Osint and base of Blue.
