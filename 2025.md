# 2025

## Explanation

I have less than 3 years in Cybersecurity. After done different research, I concluded each that each subdomain are linked together. You shouldn't study the offensive, without studying the defensive to know how to get through it, it works the other way too. This works for all areas : crypto, governance, ... knowledge in one area will have an impact on thinking and thinking about another area. This is why this year after obtaining the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) in 2024, I focused my certifications for this year on Osint and level 1 of Defensive.
